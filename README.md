# Basic-8
Simple BASIC code that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to a user-specified value

In this code:

1. The program first prompts the user to enter the number of terms in the series using the INPUT command.
2. It initializes a variable SUM to 0 to store the sum of the terms.
3. It then uses a FOR loop to iterate from 1 to N, where N is the number of terms.
4. Inside the loop, it prompts the user to enter each term and adds it to the SUM.
5. After all terms have been entered and summed, it prints out the calculated sum.
